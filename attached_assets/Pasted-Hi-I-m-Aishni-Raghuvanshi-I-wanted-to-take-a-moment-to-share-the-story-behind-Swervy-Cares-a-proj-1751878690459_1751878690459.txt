Hi, Iâ€™m Aishni Raghuvanshi. I wanted to take a moment to share the story behind Swervy Cares, a project that I have recently dedicated a lot of my time to kick off. 
In 2019, right before the world shut down because of COVID, I started making and selling cosmetics. I built a little website, opened social media pages, and slowly started building a small community of customers. I sold handmade lip glosses and lip scrubs that I carefully packaged in fun, creative containers. I was so proud of what I made. It was more than just a hobby,  it was something I truly loved.
Over time, Swervy Cosmetics started getting orders from all over the country. I even remember someone making a YouTube video reviewing the products. For three years, I ran my small business with so much passion and joy.
As I got older, I began exploring other interests, especially in AI and machine learning, and I eventually shifted my focus to those new paths. But even though my passions started to change, my love for beauty and self-care never really went away.
At the same time, something kept sticking with me. I realized that not every girl had the chance to experience the little things I was creating,  like lip gloss, scrubs, or cute makeup accessories. The things that made me feel good were things some girls didnâ€™t have access to at all. These arenâ€™t necessities in life, but they do bring joy. They help you feel confident. Theyâ€™re small, but they matter. And for girls who are already facing hard things, not having access to even these little joys can really make you feel left out.
Thatâ€™s what inspired me to start Swervy Cares. I wanted to create something that would give these beauty products to girls who might not be able to afford them. More importantly, I wanted these girls to know something they may not hear enough:
 ðŸ’— Youâ€™re beautiful. Youâ€™re worthy. You deserve this.
Swervy Cares isnâ€™t just about giving away beauty products. Itâ€™s about building confidence. 
Whether itâ€™s through beauty kits, self-care events, or just showing up for the community, my hope is that no girl feels left out because of her situation.
This is only the beginning. Iâ€™m so grateful youâ€™re here with me.
Thank you for supporting Swervy Cares. Letâ€™s keep spreading love: one lip gloss, one care package, one girl at a time.
With love,
 Aishni Raghuvanshi
