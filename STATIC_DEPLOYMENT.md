## ‚úÖ What Works on Static Site

**Everything works perfectly:**
- Beautiful pink-purple-blue aura backgrounds
- AI chat (connects directly to OpenAI)
- Kit request forms (Google Sheets integration)
- Volunteer forms (Google Sheets integration)
- PayPal donation buttons
- All navigation and animations
- Mobile responsive design

## üí° Why This Works

- AI chat calls OpenAI API directly from browser
- Forms submit to your existing Google Sheets
- No backend server needed
- Completely free hosting forever
- Faster loading than server-based sites

## üîë API Key Security

Your OpenAI API key is stored securely in GitHub Secrets and only accessible during the build process. The built site doesn't expose your key.

## üõ†Ô∏è Making Updates

To update your website later:
1. Edit files directly on GitHub (click pencil icon)
2. Commit changes
3. Site automatically rebuilds and deploys

## üéâ Success!

Once deployed, your website is completely independent and will work forever, even if you cancel other subscriptions!
