    title: "Why I Started Swervy Cares",
    excerpt: "The personal journey that led me to create a platform for empowering young girls through self-care and confidence building.",
    content: `Growing up, I was always obsessed with cosmetics like lip gloss, lip scrubs, and even lashes. These little things brought me so much joy. I'd spend hours playing dress-up, experimenting with the eyeshadow palettes my mom would bring home for me. Those simple moments made my childhood magical.

As I entered my teen years, makeup continues to become vital for me in terms of having fun and it became a way for me to express myself and build confidence. I saw first hand how beauty could empower.

But as I got older, I also became more aware of the girls and women who don't have access to that same joy. There are so many in domestic violence shelters, foster homes, and low-income schools. While people often remember to provide essentials like food and hygiene, we sometimes forget that they, too, appreciate beauty, and deserve to feel seen, celebrated, and confident.

That's why I started Swervy cares: to bring personalized beauty kits to girls who need more than just survival. They need joy. They need hope. They need to feel beautiful.

And we can give them that, one kit at a time.`,

    excerpt: "The personal journey of building an AI chat that understands makeup preferences and guides girls to their perfect self-care kit.",
    content: `Working on the AI aspect behind Swervy Cares has been such a memorable experience for me. I built an AI chat that talks with you to understand your makeup preferences based on your age and the looks you like, whether that's bold, natural, or even glam.

The idea is to support girls who might not know much about makeup but want access to these products. The AI chat guides them and redirects them to the "Request a Kit" form, making the process easy and personal. My goal is for every kit to feel tailored, whether that means including a scent tied to a favorite memory or a color that you love.

This was made with all of you in mind, and I truly hope you enjoy it.`,

    title: "Building Confidence, More Than Just Makeup",
    excerpt: "Coming soon- When we think about girls and women in domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters, or even schools where resources are limited, makeup and self-care products aren't usually the first things that come to mind. But the truth is, they really do matter.",
    content: `Coming soon- When we think about girls and women in domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters, or even schools where resources are limited, makeup and self-care products aren't usually the first things that come to mind. But the truth is, they really do matter. As a high school girl I can positively tell you that confidence IS powerful. Having something as simple as lip gloss with your favorite color, or a scent tied to a happy memory can make someone feel valued and cared for. 

Swervy Cares was created with that belief in mind. This reflection is about looking beyond the surface and understanding that my mission giving underserved girls the chance to feel confident in their own skin.`,
