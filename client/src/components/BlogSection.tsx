    title: "Why I Started Swervy Cares",
    excerpt: "The personal journey that led me to create a platform for empowering young girls through self-care and confidence building.",
    content: `Hi, I'm Aishni Raghuvanshi. I wanted to take a moment to share the story behind Swervy Cares, a project that I have recently dedicated a lot of my time to kick off.

In 2019, right before the world shut down because of COVID, I started making and selling cosmetics. I built a little website, opened social media pages, and slowly started building a small community of customers. I sold handmade lip glosses and lip scrubs that I carefully packaged in fun, creative containers. I was so proud of what I made. It was more than just a hobby, it was something I truly loved.

Over time, Swervy Cosmetics started getting orders from all over the country. I even remember someone making a YouTube video reviewing the products. For three years, I ran my small business with so much passion and joy.

As I got older, I began exploring other interests, especially in AI and machine learning, and I eventually shifted my focus to those new paths. But even though my passions started to change, my love for beauty and self-care never really went away.

At the same time, something kept sticking with me. I realized that not every girl had the chance to experience the little things I was creating, like lip gloss, scrubs, or cute makeup accessories. The things that made me feel good were things some girls didn't have access to at all. These aren't necessities in life, but they do bring joy. They help you feel confident. They're small, but they matter. And for girls who are already facing hard things, not having access to even these small luxuries felt unfair.

That's what inspired me to start Swervy Cares. I wanted to create something that would give these beauty products to girls who might not be able to afford them. More importantly, I wanted these girls to know something they may not hear enough:

üíó You're beautiful. You're worthy. You deserve this.

Swervy Cares isn't just about giving away beauty products. It's about building confidence.

Whether it's through beauty kits, self-care events, or just showing up for the community, my hope is that no girl feels left out because of her situation.

This is only the beginning. I'm so grateful you're here with me.

Thank you for supporting Swervy Cares. Let's keep spreading love: one lip gloss, one care package, one girl at a time.

With love,
Aishni Raghuvanshi`,

    excerpt: "The personal journey of building an AI chat that understands makeup preferences and guides girls to their perfect self-care kit.",
    content: `Working on the AI aspect behind Swervy Cares has been such a memorable experience for me. I built an AI chat that talks with you to understand your makeup preferences based on your age and the looks you like, whether that's bold, natural, or even glam.

The idea is to support girls who might not know much about makeup but want access to these products. The AI chat guides them and redirects them to the "Request a Kit" form, making the process easy and personal. My goal is for every kit to feel tailored, whether that means including a scent tied to a favorite memory or a color that you love.

This was made with all of you in mind, and I truly hope you enjoy it.`,

    content: `Coming soon- When we think about girls and women in domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters, or even schools where resources are limited, makeup and self-care products aren't usually the first things that come to mind. But the truth is, they really do matter. As a high school girl I can positively tell you that confidence IS powerful. Having something as simple as lip gloss with your favorite color, or a scent tied to a happy memory can make someone feel valued and cared for. 

Swervy Cares was created with that belief in mind. This reflection is about looking beyond the surface and understanding that my mission giving underserved girls the chance to feel confident in their own skin.`,
